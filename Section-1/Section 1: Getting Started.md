# Section 1: Getting Started

## What is Nuxt.js?

First what is Vue.js? 

Is a powerful framework for building web apps. It's a progressive framework, meaning that you can start with a small project and scale it up to a large project. It takes inspiration from AngularJS and React. You can build UI widgets or complete single-page-applications (SPA).

It's a complete framework that includes routing and state management. It's very lightweight which makes it very popular.

Nuxt is not a new framework, it builds on top of Vue.js. It mainly makes it easier to develop applications

One of the core feature is allowing creation of universal apps by making it easy to create server-side rendered (SSR) applications. (aka building the page on the server side and sending it to the client)

It has a configuration via file and folder structure approach. (for example, routes defined based on the folder structure).
