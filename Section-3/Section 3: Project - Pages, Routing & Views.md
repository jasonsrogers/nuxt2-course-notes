# Section 3: Project - Pages, Routing & Views

Let's build a complete blog where we'll apply what we've covered until now and expand on it with concepts introduced in later sections

## Creating the main "Sections" (Pages)

We're going to use the folder base approach to create our routes as we'll have sub pages (nested routes) in several sections

We're going to create the following routes:
- about
- posts
- posts/:id
- admin
